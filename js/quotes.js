var hankquotes = ["We often just accept things that we like and complain a lot about the things that we don't like. But if we could, like, intensely dwell on the really great things in life the way we intensely dwell on the negative things in life. I think that would be fantastic.", "It's almost as if out society values opinion more than it values knowledge.", "The way that we look does not have anything to do with the way we sound, or the way that we are. We like to think so, in fact we like to think so so much that we tend to dress up like people that we are similar to. We all kind of wear uniforms.", "It turns out, somehow, there are a tremendous number of things to be optimistic about.", "It turns out, somehow, there are a tremendous number of things to be optimistic about.", "But when you are being physically and psychologically tortured, it is difficult to remove yourself from the pressingness of the moment at hand. Here's how I dealt with bullying: I cried, I hated myself, I hated my life. I didn't deal with it, I survived it, but I never dealt with it. So here are two tips from someone with lots of experience. 1: It's not about you, it has nothing to do with you, it's about the assholes doing it to you. 2: Your job is not to deal with it, your job is to survive it, which you CAN do because it WILL end. And then yes, it will get better.", "Read books. Care about things. Get excited. Try not to be too down on yourself.

The whole world is grey, and if you just appreciate that, then it's beautiful.", "I'm just trying to remember that the world is a good place, and the number of hugs per gunshot victim is very, very high.", "I live in the present due to constraints of the space-time continuum.", "We are all differently broken, semi-functional, rusted out love machines.", "And maybe that's what we should be trying for at the end of our lives... for the world to be less good without us.", "You do not exist to please someone else. You exist for your own sake.","NO EDGE","And when I think about that sunrise that I wole up to that morning, I just feel like I got as close to nowhere as I could get, and found out that it was more of a place than anywhere I've been in a long time.","But here's the real deal... your idol (probably) didn't become idolizable by playing the game as it existed. They redefined the game, took advantage of new technologies, innovated","By the traditional definition of fair, it's like the fairest thing that ever happened, right? Everybody who's ever lived either has or is going to die...It's and equitable arrangement.","Some days it seems to me like the purpose of life is to convert energy into beauty. And I know that's not true. I know that's not rationally true. But sometimes it's okay for things to not be rationally true.","I most fear that the wonderful way I live my life today will ruin life for generations of people to come.","Instead of thinking about what you will and won't accomplish in your life, think about the problems you have helped solve and you will help solve and the things you're gonna help make and that you've already helped.","I do not want to live in a world where we only focus on suck and never think about awesome.","If someone calls you a fag, say 'Oh!

It always seems like it's hardest for you, but your success and your happiness has much more to do with understanding other people around you than it does with understanding yourself.

It sounds cliche, but you have to think about everyone like they're people, and suddenly you realize that 90% of teenagers have moments where they want to cut themselves, pull out their hair, punch their best friend and sit crying in the shower. And EVERYONE was once a teenager...that goes for your teachers, parents, rock idols, and grand parents...and those people all made it through.","We all know that video games are a simplification of real life, but I think that's what's so compelling about them because real life is complicated. Video games give us goals and you know when you've failed and when you've succeeded; in real life, that's pretty rare, especially as you get older. Everything you do is a combination of success and failure. There is no moment of which you complete the mission and say 'Ah, I am done, thank you' because the mission is life and it only completes when you die.","I think one of the principle facets of being a mature and healthy and effective person is understanding that you are almost always wrong.","I like three-legged dogs, because if I was missing a leg I would be like: 'URGH, life sucks when missing a leg. Slow down! I can't walk that fast, I'm missing a freaking leg!!' And dogs? No! A three legged dog is on it. Exactly the same amount of happy as a  four-legged dog! That's why I like three-legged dogs. They have taken their three-leggedness and they embrace it.","But the truth of the matter is, to live a good life, as a good person, it doesn't matter how you got there. It just matters that you do.","Next time you have a bad day, remember that it is amazing that you are alive at all, much less a member of a self-aware species living at the height of human technological progress.","We need more completely sane people doing completely crazy things.","The satisfaction?

var johnquotes =["Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we're quoting.", "Will this be on the test? Yeah, about the test. The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged, and productive citizen of the world, and it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms and in places of worship. You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football, and while scrolling through your Twitter feed. The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages, whether you'll easily be persuaded by empty political rhetoric, and whether you'll be able to place your life and your community in a broader context. The test will last your entire life, and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions, that when taken together, make your life yours. And everything -- EVERYTHING -- will be on it.", "You are helpful, and you are loved, and you are forgiven, and you are not alone.", "Imagining the future is a kind of nostalgia. You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you'll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.", "How improbable are WE? How stange, and how lovely, it is to be anything at all.", "We can never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken.", "True love will triumph in the end - which may or may not be a lie, but if it is a lie, then it's the most beautiful lie we have.", "The Venn diagram of 'boys who don't like smart girls' and 'boys you don't want to date' is a circle.", "The world may be broken, but hope is not crazy.", "I'm a giant squid of anger.", "I've learned that humans generally get less miserable when we collaborate.", "High school is not destiny... The course of your life isn't decided. Ever. Most of the time it's not like there's like one fork in the road and you choose one or you choose the other, there are hundreds of forks in the road every day that you're alive. College is also not destiny... your twenties are not destiny! Your thirties are not destiny. Destiny is not something that happens all at once. It's something that happens only in retrospect.", "I don't know a perfect person, I only know flawed people who are still worth loving.", "Pizza. The answer is always pizza.","We need you, we believe you, and we're counting on you. Best wishes.","Saying 'I noticed you're a nerd' is like saying, 'Hey, I notice that you'd rather be intelligent than be stupid, that you'd rather be thoughtful than be vapid, that you believe that there are things that matter more than the arrest record of Lindsay Lohan. Why is that?' In fact, it seems to me that most contemporary insults are pretty lame. Even 'lame' is kind of lame. Saying 'You're lame' is like saying 'You walk with a limp.' Yeah, whatever, so does 50 Cent, and he's done all right for himself.","You don't remember what happened. What you remember becomes what happened.","Just move to the Internet, it's great here.

The job of reading is to see into other people as we see ourselves.","I have a great affection for people who are intellectually engaged with the world, and who don't treat everything superficially. And I think, when people talk about nerdiness, what they're really talking about is smart people who are trying to think hard about the world. And I don't think that's an insult, I think that's a great thing.","It's very sad to me that some people are so intent on leaving their mark on the world that they don't care if that mark is a scar.","What a treacherous thing it is to believe that a person is more than a person.","Nerd like us, are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about stuff. Nerds are allowed to love stuff, like, jump-up-and-down-in-your-chair-can't-control-yourself love it. When people call people nerds, mostly what they're saying is 'You like stuff.' Which is not a good insult at all. Like 'You are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human consiousness.'","Let me explain why I like to pay taxes for schools even though I don't personally have a kid in school: I don't like living in a country with a bunch of stupid people.","You can love someone so much... but you can never love people as much as you can miss them.","My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.","If only we could see the endless string of consequences that result from our smallest actions.

Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get angry, get good and angry. Try to be alive. You will be dead soon enough.","Did you always wear glasses? Well, no, not when I came out of my mother's womb. Initially after the womb-birth-experience I was not wearing glasses, but then I did put them on shortly afterwards when I was about one day old because I just didn't look good without them.","Caring about stuff binds us to the other people who care about that stuff and that creates the communities that make life worth living.","Those trampolines are just close enough to each other to invite poor decisions and just far enough apart to punish those poor decisions.","Every year, many many stupid people graduate from college.
